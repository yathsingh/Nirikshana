Nirikshana End to End Water Monitoring System

Nirikshana utilises a robust hardware device to collect and wirelessly transmit water-quality data using numerous sensors (pH, turbidity, water quality, water flow). 
The data is then sent to the backend where it is passed through an ML pipeline to predict water safety, and the finalised data is sent to an interative dashboard 
where one can see alerts, statistics and recently collected data to get an extensive overview. 

*Machine Learning Model*
Currently Used: Random Forest with 'max_depth': None, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 500
Planned: XGBoost -> Custom deep learning pipeline
